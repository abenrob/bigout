The Unicode Line Breaking Algorithm performs part of this process. \n> Given an input text, it produces a set of positions called \"break opportunities\" that are appropriate points to begin a new line. \n> The selection of actual line break positions from the set of break opportunities is not covered by the Unicode Line Breaking Algorithm, \n> but is in the domain of higher level software with knowledge of the available width and the display size of the text.\n\nThis is a JavaScript/CoffeeScript implementation of the \n[Unicode Line Breaking Algorithm](http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr14/#SampleCode) for Node.js \n(and browsers I guess).  It is used by [PDFKit](http://github.com/devongovett/pdfkit/) for \nline wrapping text in PDF documents, but since the algorithm knows nothing about the actual\nvisual appearance or layout of text, it could be used for other things as well.\n\n## Installation\n\nYou can install via npm\n\n    npm install linebreak\n\n## Example\n\n```javascript\nvar LineBreaker = require('linebreak');\n\nvar lorem = 'lorem ipsum...';\nvar breaker = new LineBreaker(lorem);\nvar last = 0;\nvar bk;\n\nwhile (bk = breaker.nextBreak()) {\n  // get the string between the last break and this one\n  var word = lorem.slice(last, bk.position);\n  console.log(word);\n  \n  // you can also check bk.required to see if this was a required break...\n  if (bk.required) {\n    console.log('\\n\\n');\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Development Notes\n\nIn order to use the library, you shouldn't need to know this, but if you're interested in\ncontributing or fixing bugs, these things might be of interest.\n\n* The `src/classes.coffee` file is automatically generated from `LineBreak.txt` in the Unicode \n  database by `src/generate_data.coffee`. It should be rare that you need to run this, but\n  you may if, for instance, you want to change the Unicode version.\n  \n* You can run the tests using `npm test`. They are written using `mocha`, and generated from\n  `LineBreakTest.txt` from the Unicode database, which is included in the repository for performance\n  reasons while running them. About 150 of the over 6000 tests are currently skipped due to\n  implementation differences. It appears that some of the tests may be wrong or use different\n  tailoring from the spec.\n\n## License\n\nMIT",
